============================================

Pathological example:

pure function OPERATION(x,y) result(r)
  INTEGER :: x, y, r
  r = MAX(a,b,THIS_IMAGE())
end function

This OPERATION is a pure function as defined in F23 15.7 and 16.1. 
It is associative and commutative.
It also satisfies all the other requirements for the OPERATION argument to
CO_REDUCE or CO_REDUCE_PREFIX_* with A of integer type.

Passing this OPERATION along with the following arguments to either CO_REDUCE
or CO_REDUCE_PREFIX_* will reveal some information about which images evaluated
the OPERATION for any given input element (and for any given image's result).

A = [0, 0]
INITIAL = 0

Other similar OPERATION functions can be crafted over a derived type to reveal
arbitrary information about which images executed the operation and even in
what order.

Potential resolution for all CO_REDUCE intrinsics:
"OPERATION shall not depend on the value of THIS_IMAGE()."
